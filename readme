===========
Simple implementation of tic-tac-toe game using the Minimax algorithm.
Written on Golang.

How to run?
-----------
To challenge yourself playing against AI, you can use the bash-script below: 

    $ ./play.sh

Also you can do it manually by building the binary file: 
    
    $ go build -o bin/ttt src/game.go && ./bin/ttt
    
[optional] 
    After building put binary file into the $PATH directory, f.e directory where do you store your scripts locally (default: ~/.local/bin).
    So, you can play anytime directly from the terminal when you're bored.
